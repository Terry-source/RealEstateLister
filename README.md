# What was your biggest challenge?

Pages kept crashing because I forgot to pass title to the controller when rendering the view.

# What are your key learnings/takeaways/favourite part?

Adding links to all linked collections when creating a property. Ie linking a user/owner and a suburb to each new property listing, so that properties can be listed according to suburb or user.
